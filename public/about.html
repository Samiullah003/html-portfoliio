<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  Hi, I'm <strong>Samiullah Khan</strong>, a passionate student on a journey to
  become a full stack web developer. I'm currently learning the essentials of
  web development, diving into both front-end and back-end technologies to build
  real-world applications.
</p>

<p>
  My interest in technology and coding has grown steadily, and I'm focused on
  mastering tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and eventually moving into
  frameworks like React and Node.js. Every line of code I write brings me closer
  to my goal of building interactive and meaningful web experiences.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond the screen, I enjoy <strong>gaming</strong>,
  <strong>reading a bit</strong>, <strong>taking long walks</strong>, and
  <strong>playing football</strong> whenever I get the chance. These moments
  keep me energized and creative.
</p>

<p>
  I believe learning never stops, and I'm excited to keep growing, building, and
  one day contributing to something impactful in the tech world.
</p>
