<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO SAM</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all times</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Kal ho na hoo</h3>
<p>
  One of my favorites movie because of the casting and storyline perfectly done
  in this movie. At the end everything is alright and gives one of the lessons
  in life that spread love and keep smiling
</p>
<h3>Hum Sath sath hai</h3>
<p>
  Now a days people might find this movie boring but it spreads the message of
  unity and love and let other people's opinion destroy your family
</p>
<h3>Pokemon</h3>
<p>
  Its not a movie even though it includes movies but vastly its a anime series
  of the journey of Ash Ketchum and to become pokemon master
